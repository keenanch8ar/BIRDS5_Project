# BIRDS-5 Nanosatellite


## Overview
BIRDS-5 Nanosatellites are 1U and 2U nanosatellites developed at the Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech) as part of the BIRDS Nanosatellite Program. These satellites carry a Multispectral/RGB imaging payload as well as APRS Digipeating payloads. This repository contains the software code and documentation for the OBC, which serves as the central command and data-handling subsystem of the BIRDS-5 satellite developed at the Kyushu Institute of Technology.


## Key Features
- **Mission Control**: Manages the functioning of other subsystems and interfaces with payload interface boards.
- **Data Handling**: Handles the processing, storage, and transmission of mission data.
- **Fault Detection and Recovery**: Implements algorithms for fault detection and recovery to ensure the robustness of the satellite's operation.
- **Power Management**: Monitors and manages the power consumption of the OBC and other subsystems.
- **Communications Interface**: Interfaces with the Communication System (COM) for data communication and transmission.
